Amazon generates a massive amount of user review data, which reflects amazon customer sentiments, preference on products, and feedback trends. Customer reviews play a vital role in shaping business strategies and customer decisions. In this project, we aim to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the dataset of ‘Amazon Fine Food Reviews’ and bring insights for business and consumers.

Consumers and businesses heavily rely on product reviews to make purchasing decisions and for future order strategy. While sentiment analysis alone is valuable, reviews can offer much more potential for deriving insights. Businesses could benefit from predictive capabilities, trend analysis and an understanding of why reviews are helpful or not. Through this project, we aim to address:
Understanding customer sentiments
Extracting thematic trends over time
Predicting customer ratings using review text
Identifying anomalies in feedback
