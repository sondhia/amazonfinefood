We have run the t5-small with and without beam search till now. For memory constraints, we have only used 1000 rows out of the possible 500k rows dataset but are looking to expand this to 10k rows.

t5-small-greedy is the metrics screenshot for beam search.
t-small_2_batchsize is the metrics screenshot for our model training without the beam search.
